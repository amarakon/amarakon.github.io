Recall from my [second](articles/education-wants-to-dumb-down-technology/) article on this website that I did not like my school's [computer science](http://localhost:1313/articles/education-wants-to-dumb-down-technology/#computer-science) club.
I listed several reasons for it, and I will briefly summarize them here.

- The teacher taught in a traditional way rather than what I expected.
- Only the Python programming language is taught.
  - Python is slow, easy, high-level, and interpreted
- They did not help us **understand** how programming works, so it still seemed like magic to us.
- The environment we programmed in was normie-friendly, dishonestly dumbing it down.

I consider Harvard's CS50 course (which can be taken online or in-campus) to be the exact opposite of my school's computer science club.
That is why I like it so much.
It is not intended for people more experienced in programming.
Actually, it is intended for **everyone**, whether you are just getting into computer science or if you already have experience in it.
David Malan, the charismatic, effective teacher for CS50, acknowledges that most people who are taking Computer Science in university have no prior experience in programming.
Most of them are normies.

But the difference between David Malan and my previous teacher is that David Malan wants to get people out of the normie way of thinking about technology.
He does this by teaching students to have a fundamental understanding of how computers work.
This prevents computer science from being dumbed down and seeming like magic.
Because all of the programs we use on our computers, no matter how complex they are, have been written by humans just like you and I.
He taught us how to program starting from the **bottom-up** instead of **top-down**.

# Top-Down Teaching Versus Bottom-Up Teaching

The mindset of people who prefer teaching a top-down approach of computer programming is this:

> Software is incredibly complex, and that scares away most people from programming.
I think the best way to prevent them from being scared of it is to make it seem as simple as possible.
We will use the easiest programming languages on the easiest operating systems to create the easiest programs.
Then, we will get to the more complex languages and operating systems to create programs that are faster.
We do not need to teach what binary code is because nobody will need to write it anymore.

It is true that software is incredibly complex, and that most of us will never understand everything that runs on our computers.
It does scare most people away from programming, but the people who will learn it anyway do not need coddling.
Programming can never appear **simple**, because it is the opposite of that.
It takes several lines of code to do the most basic things, and most of the popular software we run are thousands or even millions of single lines of code.
Some people think that Python is the "easiest" programming language but the truth is; there is no easiest programming language.
They all have their own uses.
You cannot progressively go from teaching high-level languages to teaching low-level languages because people will not want to learn low-level languages because they are more cryptic.
Finally, just because no one writes binary code anymore, does not mean that no one needs to understand it.
Computer science is not just about **coding**, it is about having an actual understanding about how your computer can **understand** code.

The mindset of people who prefer teaching a bottom-up approach of computer programming is this:

> Software is incredibly complex, and that scares away most people from programming.
I think the best way to prevent them from being scared is to help them understand what programming actually is.
We will start all the way down from binary code, and then teach students how a programming language converts something into binary code.
We will start with the lower-level programming languages like C.
Then, we will get to the more syntactically readable languages once they already have an understanding of lower-level ones.
We must teach not only **how** to code, but also **why** to code and what code actually is.

# CS50 is Actually Fun

One of the biggest problems I have with the western education system is how boring it is.
It just seems so... pointless.
The only classes that actually seem important to me are English and Math (even the latter not so much).
We are just taught **how** but never **why**.
However, being taught **why** is just as important as being taught **how**.
This is obviously no accident.
The purpose of the western education system is to shill people to become **obedient workers**.
This makes it all the more depressing and soul-sucking.

Although CS50 is a university course, I surprisingly liked it.
It is everything I ever wanted in a computer science.
It solves all the issues I initially had with the education system.
First of all, the teacher David Malan is so charismatic and energetic and that is perfect for a course like this.
We are taught **why** just as frequently as we are taught **how**.
It genuinely restores my faith in computer science education.
As an added bonus, each lecture usually has an Easter egg or something surprising to keep people entertained.
It keeps me coming back and ambitious to learn more, something the school system was never able to do.

# The Software We Used is What They Use in the Real World

This is honestly the most surprising part for me: a computer science course that actually teaches computer science in the real world!
Back in my computer science club at school, we were literally told to write code in a website.
But you cannot create real projects while doing that.
You can only complete assignments.
On the contrast, we were forced to use real-world software in CS50.
For example, we used git to submit assignments, how wonderful!
And since I am already experienced with git, it made me a better with git as well.

The motivation behind teaching people fake software is to coddle programmers to protect them from the changes they will have to make once they work in the real world.
**That is because the purpose of dumbing down technology is to ultimately deter them from it.**
Whereas Harvard's CS50 course does the opposite: They teach people that they are going to have to make changes in their choice of software.
You're going to have to use GNU/Linux as opposed to Windows or macOS.
You're going to have to use git as opposed to some other file tracking system.
You're not just going to learn to compile your code, you're going to learn what compiling is.
I could go on and on, but you get the idea.

# Conclusion

The best conclusion I can think of is that I am just... surprised.
Surprised is the best word I can think of to describe this experience.
I am surprised because it is everything I ever wanted in a computer science course.
So I am going to challenge myself and complete it, not only for the certificate, but also for fun.
And it is completely **free** (as in price and freedom) to join the course online.
If you do not like it, you can drop out of it, and it will not be a waste of time at all.
I could not recommend it enough.
