					<p>Many people feel the need to spend a lot of money on technology.
They think that because technology is complex and vast, they should buy from the most expensive brands.
I think that the opposite is true.
Because technology is complex and vast, we should buy cheap but great tech products.
Most importantly, we should buy technology that we actually understand.
Ultra-complex technology takes advantage of everyone who uses it because no one can understand it.
This is why we should only use technology that is simple and easy to understand.
You can get by spending one quarter of what most people spend.
I will prove it with various examples.</p>
<h1 id="products">Products</h1>
<p>These are the products I recommend over the expensive options.
All dollar figures are presented in Canadian money.
Four Canadian dollars equals 3 American dollars.</p>
<h2 id="computer">Computer</h2>
<p>Most people spend over $1000 dollars on a computer or laptop.
This is extremely overkill, because the main purpose of a computer is just to work and browse the Web.
Unless, you have a specific reason to, never buy a Macbook.
They are expensive and terrible machines.
Even worse than their unreasonable price, they are pro-consumerism.
Apple wants to create an ecosystem where consumers of their products only buy from Apple.
Most people who buy Macbooks do not need the fast hardware it offers.
When you buy a product from Apple, you are buying only the brand.
It is restrictive and terrible for your computing freedom.</p>

</p>
<p>A good laptop only costs about $200.
I recommend the ThinkPad T420.
It is powerful enough for a laptop released in 2008.
Its CPU has two cores and four threads and its speed is 3.2 GHz.
That is almost equivalent to a $150 Ryzen 3 1200.
Since it is not degenerate, it actually has things that people might want to use.
It was a lot of USB ports, Ethernet, a DVD reader, DisplayPort and VGA but unfortunately no HDMI.
If you do not need to use the DVD reader, you can replace it for a catty that holds an extra storage drive.
The only downside of the ThinkPad T420 is that its battery life is not good.
A nine-cell battery only lasts about three hours while six-cell batteries last a maximum of two hours.
At least the battery is easily replaceable.</p>
<h2 id="cellphone">Cellphone</h2>
<p>I do not recommend the use of a smartphone.
Most of them are ridiculously expensive, some are more expensive than computers.
But the purpose of a cellphone is just to use SMS, so why would anyone feel the need to spend so much money on such a device?
The price is only one issue of countless others though.
You can get a cheap Android phone for only $200.
Most modern phones are made of glass instead of plastic so that they shatter easily.
Modifying their hardware—like replacing the battery, is also restricted and much more difficult.
You can get by without a smartphone.
Do not let anyone fool you into believing otherwise.</p>
<p>I recommend a cheap flip-phone.
The challenge will be finding one that can actually make texts and calls with providers as they are today
Find one that works with your provider.
You are going to need to buy a newer flip-phone for that.
Better yet, do not even buy a cellphone if you do not need one.
A cellphone is a massively overlooked privacy risk.
It is used by the government and corporations to control what people think.
And it is naive to think that you are the exception, you can think more critically, and you are not a victim of this indoctrination.</p>
<h2 id="headphones">Headphones</h2>
<p>For the love of God, do not buy AirPods.
I could make a whole blog post that is a rant on why I hate AirPods and the negative affects they have on society.
They are over $200 and they have nothing good about them to make up for it, at all.
You could get Apple&rsquo;s earbuds for about $10 in a dollar store and it is basically the exact same.
The only difference is that AirPods are wireless.
But wireless headphones are worse than wired headphones, mainly because of their noticeably worse quality.
Wireless technology is a security risk unlike traditional wired technology.
It is also unknown if they are bad for your health, but it is certainly possible that they are.</p>
<p>I got carried away criticizing AirPods and I forgot to recommend a good pair of headphones.
Get a good-quality pair of Edifier headphones I guess.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h2>
<p>You should use the keyboard that comes preinstalled to your laptop.
Otherwise, buy a ThinkPad desktop keyboard.
Mechanical keyboards are good, but they are loud and expensive.
Even the so-called &ldquo;silent&rdquo; switches are not even close to being silent.
Everything else is louder by far.
I use the ThinkPad keyboard on my laptop because it is reliable and comfortable.</p>
<h2 id="mouse">Mouse</h2>
<p>I do not even condone the usage of a mouse.
You should buy a keyboard that includes a trackpoint.
A trackpoint is a dot in the middle of the keyboard that allows you to move your cursor.
It is less precise than a mouse, but much faster to use because you do not need to move your right hand away from the keyboard.
This allows you to seamlessly transition between typing and moving your mouse.
If you need a mouse for the precision, I recommend a cheap gaming mouse from amazon.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>You should not conclude from this article that expensive technology is always bad.
It is only mostly bad.
What you should conclude is that you should not need to spend money that us unnecessary.
If you can spend less money, do it.
But if you need something expensive, buy it if you can.
Most people buy expensive things not because they <strong>need</strong> them, but because they <strong>want</strong> them.
You should get out of this mentality if you are already in it.</p>
<p>P.S. Old tech products are almost always better than new ones.</p>
