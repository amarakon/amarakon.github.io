Recall from my [second](articles/education-wants-to-dumb-down-technology/) article on this website that I did not like my school's [computer science](http://localhost:1313/articles/education-wants-to-dumb-down-technology/#computer-science) club.
I listed several reasons for it, and I will briefly summarize them here.

- The teacher teached in a tradional way rather than what I expected.
- Only the Python programming language is taught.
  - Python is slow, easy, high-level, and interpreted
- They did not help us **understand** how programming works, so it still seemed like magic to us.
- The environment we programmed in was normie-friendly, dishonestly dumbing it down.

I consider Harvard's CS50
