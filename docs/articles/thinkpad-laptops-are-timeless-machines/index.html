					<p>It is important to favor timeless computers over timed ones.
Timed computers are designed to last only a short period of time; maybe a year or so.
This is because they are designed to be not only fragile but also difficult to repair.
This cruel combination manifests a consumerist mindset into most people.
Timeless computers are designed to last as long as possible.
They are always durable and reliable, not just the hardware but also the software.</p>
<h1 id="aspects-of-a-timed-computer">Aspects of a Timed Computer</h1>
<p>Timed computers usually take the form of Macbooks and Surfaces.
Macbooks are thin, light, and sleek.
But they are built for an extremely restrictive, oppressive ecosystem.
There are not enough ports, Apple discourages you from repairing your computer, it only works well with other Apple products.
Surfaces are also thin, light, and sleek.
But they are so pathetically weak.
They use outdated processors and a low amount of memory, this cannot justify the four-digit price.
Timed computers are not the only problem, their consumers are too.</p>
<h1 id="aspects-of-a-timeless-computer">Aspects of a Timeless Computer</h1>
<p>Timeless computers are basically the exact opposite of timed computers.
They are usually bulky and &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; by today&rsquo;s unrealistic standards.</p>

<p>Most timeless computers are unsurprisingly old.
Figure <a href="#fig:thiccpad">1</a> is just an exxageration of what old computers look like.
My computer is the ThinkPad T420 and it is from 2008.
Many people have a false view of old computers that they are slow and unreliable.
The opposite is true.
Older computers are faster, more reliable, and last longer.
My processor&rsquo;s maximum frequency is 3.2 GHz which is equivalent to the AMD Ryzen 3 1200 on my gaming computer!</p>
<p>Timeless computers always respect users&rsquo; freedom.
They will have many ports, and there will be little to no need for an adapter.
They always have dozens of USB ports, a VGA port, a DVD reader, and HDMI or DisplayPort.
Unfortunately, the ThinkPad T420 does not have an HDMI port.
This is a computer from 2008, so it is forgivable.
It is absolutely unforgivable for a Macbook though.
Since they respect users&rsquo; freedom, timeless computers do not try to restrict their users&rsquo; from opening the computer and replacing parts.</p>
<h1 id="thinkpads">ThinkPads</h1>
<p>I favor ThinkPads over all other types of computers.
New ThinkPads are garbage though because they give in to modernism.
The only acceptable ThinkPads are old ThinkPads.
The oldest ThinkPads (the ones made my IBM) might be too slow for you.
So for the sweetspot, I recommend the following four models.</p>
<h2 id="t400">T400</h2>
<p>Richard Stallman uses the ThinkPad T400S.
The difference between the T400 and T400S is not important.
It is the most powerful ThinkPad laptop that can run Libreboot.
Libreboot is a boot firmware that does not include any proprietary software.
The intel processor running on the ThinkPad T400 does not yet have the Management Engine.
Privacy is not the only reason you should use the ThinkPad T400, but it is the main selling point</p>
<h2 id="t420">T420</h2>
<p>The T420 is much more powerful than the T400.
The T400&rsquo;s processor&rsquo;s frequency runs at 2.4 GHz while the T420&rsquo;s runs at 3.2 GHz.
This makes the T420 considerably faster—but it also drains the battery quicker.
Unfortunately, the T420 does not have anything that makes the T400 so special.
It does not support Libreboot.
This is not only bad for your privacy, but this will slow down your boot times.
The processor runs Intel&rsquo;s Management Engine, which is an engine in the processor that tracks processes.
It is your decision whether you should favor speed or freedom.
The ThinkPad T420 is still Lenovo&rsquo;s last good ThinkPad.</p>
<h2 id="x200">X200</h2>
<p>The Thinkpad X200 is a smaller version of the ThinkPad T400.</p>
