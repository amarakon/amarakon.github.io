      <description>Recall from my second article on this website that I did not like my school&amp;rsquo;s computer science club. I listed several reasons for it, and I will briefly summarize them here.
 The teacher taught in a traditional way rather than what I expected. Only the Python programming language is taught.</description>

      <description>I always support minimizing the amount of money you spend on technology. I have made that crystal clear. There are many things that people are spending way too much money on. But there are also many things that people are buying that they do not even need. An example of this is the mouse.</description>

      <description>It is important to favor timeless computers over timed ones. Timed computers are designed to last only a short period of time; maybe a year or so. This is because they are designed to be not only fragile but also difficult to repair. This cruel combination manifests a consumerist mindset into most people.</description>

      <description>Qualifications  In order for me to consider them good, web browsers must
  not send analytics. It should not make analytics either. I do not want to hear about how it maintains the software’s survival. I genuinely do not care. I do not want “bug reports.”</description>

      <title>Comparing the Best Markup Languages for Making PDF Documents</title>

      <description>PDF is rightfully the standard output format for documents. All word processors can output to PDF, but it is difficult to convert PDF to files word processors can edit. Most people use “what you see is what you get” word processors like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LibreOffice Writer. This type of word processor is convenient but it is also limited and unprofessional.</description>

      <title>You Should Prefer Command-Line Software</title>
      <link>https://amarakon.github.io/articles/you-should-prefer-command-line-software/</link>

      <description>There are many benefits of preferring command-line software over graphical software. Graphical User Interfaces generally promote lazy thinking. Command-line interfaces generally promote critical thinking. I think it is unfortunate that most people have not even heard of command-line software.

      <description>Most people view programming as something that only a specific type of people are able to do and should do.
