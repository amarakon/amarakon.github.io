      <description>Introduction Vim is a text editor that is great on its own but is heavily improved by various plugins. The vast majority of the plugins in this article will not be language-specific, so they will apply whether you are coding in C or just writing a random text file. I do indeed use Neovim and not Vim, but there is only one plugin in this list that is Neovim-specific. And it does have Vim-compatible alternatives anyway.</description>

      <description>Recall from my second article on this website that I did not like my school&amp;rsquo;s computer science club. I listed several reasons for it, and I will briefly summarize them here.
 The teacher taught in a traditional way rather than what I expected. Only the Python programming language is taught.  Python is slow, easy, high-level, and interpreted   They did not help us understand how programming works, so it still seemed like magic to us.</description>

      <description>I always support minimizing the amount of money you spend on technology. I have made that crystal clear. There are many things that people are spending way too much money on. But there are also many things that people are buying that they do not even need. An example of this is the mouse.
Figure 1: Cool gaming mouse
 No, not that mouse. I am talking about computer mice. Computer mice are usually cheap; not costing more than $20.</description>

      <title>ThinkPad Laptops are Timeless Machines</title>

      <description>It is important to favor timeless computers over timed ones. Timed computers are designed to last only a short period of time; maybe a year or so. This is because they are designed to be not only fragile but also difficult to repair. This cruel combination manifests a consumerist mindset into most people. Timeless computers are designed to last as long as possible. They are always durable and reliable, not just the hardware but also the software.</description>

      <title>Stop Spending Too Much Money on Technology</title>

      <description>Many people feel the need to spend a lot of money on technology. They think that because technology is complex and vast, they should buy from the most expensive brands. I think that the opposite is true. Because technology is complex and vast, we should buy cheap but great tech products. Most importantly, we should buy technology that we actually understand. Ultra-complex technology takes advantage of everyone who uses it because no one can understand it.</description>

      <title>Should You Disallow Your Kid to Have a Smartphone</title>
      <link>http://example.org/articles/should-you-disallow-your-kid-to-have-a-smartphone/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/articles/should-you-disallow-your-kid-to-have-a-smartphone/</guid>
      <description>There is sadly too little debate about if you should disallow your kid to have a smartphone. This is an important discussion. There are good arguments for and against it. But most people just let their kids do whatever without thinking through it deeply. This is dangerous and careless behavior. You should heavily regulate what your kids are able to do to protect them, as a parent always should. There should be no exceptions for smartphones.</description>

      <title>Transgender Ideology is False, Self-Destructive, and Immoral</title>

      <description>You cannot change the reality of who you are. You cannot change your race, sex, age because those are immutable properties. Most people in society understand and accept this fact. But the left has created terms called “gender” and “transgender” to get around this. They know believe it is possible to change one’s sex, but they relabeled it as “gender.” They argue that sex is biological while gender is a social construct.</description>

      <description>Jordan Peterson is a Canadian clinical psychologist that is now known for his counter-narrative political views. He became famous after standing up against Bill C-16 which forces compelled speech. He is also mainly known for criticizing the radical left. He is often described as conservative by the right. However, just because he criticizes left-wing extremists, does not mean he is a conservative He said in an interview that he’s “no right-winger.</description>

      <description>PDF is rightfully the standard output format for documents. All word processors can output to PDF, but it is difficult to convert PDF to files word processors can edit. Most people use “what you see is what you get” word processors like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LibreOffice Writer. This type of word processor is convenient but it is also limited and unprofessional. It is easier to get into, but it is harder to use in the long run.</description>

      <title>Abortion, Capital Punishment, and Euthanasia – When is Killing Acceptable</title>
      <link>http://example.org/articles/abortion-capital-punishment-and-euthanasia-when-is-killing-acceptable/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/articles/abortion-capital-punishment-and-euthanasia-when-is-killing-acceptable/</guid>
      <description>Conservatives and liberals strongly disagree on when killing another human being should be considered acceptable. They both agree that killing is justified in self-defense, but the agreements end there. Conservatives usually think that abortion and euthanasia are wrong while capital punishment (the death penalty) is just. They argue that killing an innocent and defenseless person (abortion and euthanasia) is always wrong while killing soulless criminals (the death penalty) is just. On the other hand, liberals think that abortion and euthanasia are sometimes justifiable while the death penalty is unjust.</description>

      <title>You Should Prefer Command-Line Software</title>
      <link>http://example.org/articles/you-should-prefer-command-line-software/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/articles/you-should-prefer-command-line-software/</guid>
      <description>There are many benefits of preferring command-line software over graphical software. Graphical User Interfaces generally promote lazy thinking. Command-line interfaces generally promote critical thinking. I think it is unfortunate that most people have not even heard of command-line software. Whenever I would be doing my work in school by running commands, most people who pass by would assume that I am coding. This is obviously because they have not used command-line programs, so their view of a dark terminal window and fast typing of commands they do not understand leads them to this conclusion.</description>

      <title>Programming is Invaluable for Everyone</title>

      <description>Most people view programming as something that only a specific type of people are able to do and should do. This specific type of person is portrayed as a genius; smarter than everyone else. This means that they think most normal people are unable to learn programming because they are not smart enough. But since they do not want to learn it themselves, they make the excuse that it is not important for them.</description>

      <title>Gentoo Linux Should be Approved by the Free Software Foundation</title>
      <link>http://example.org/articles/gentoo-linux-should-be-approved-by-the-free-software-foundation/</link>

      <description>Gentoo Linux is a 100% free operating system. All of its source code is publicly available on GitHub, meaning that it’s open-source. It is licensed under a free license: GNU General Public License (Version 2). It does not include any preinstalled proprietary software. Its package manager, Portage, blocks proprietary software against the user’s will by default. All of these reasons prove that is a completely free operating system that is against the use of proprietary software, so it should be in the Free Software Foundation’s (FSF) list of free Linux distributions.</description>

Contrary to popular belief, installing this operating system is not difficult in the slightest but it is certainly time consuming. Usually it will take around five hours to install.

      <description>I am a high school student who happens to be genuinely interested in technology. Specifically, I am interested in operating systems, programming, and free software philosophy. I have a good understanding of what makes a good piece of technology and what makes a bad piece of technology. One of the most important factors in this distinction is the effort it requires to use it. If a piece of technology is extremely complicated but effortless to use (i.</description>

      <title>You Should Pay Attention to Your Choice of Software</title>

      <description>What I have noticed about many subjects in life is that many people just want to be sheep. Notice how I said &amp;ldquo;want to be sheep&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;are sheep.&amp;rdquo; That is because my emphasis is on the fact that people are choosing to be ignorant. This is true in many cases, especially in politics and computing. In this post, I will be focusing on computing. I want to clarify by saying that I think there is nothing wrong with being ignorant, but it is wrong to be willfully ignorant.</description>
