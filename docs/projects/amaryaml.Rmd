https://github.com/amarakon/amaryaml

It has a terrible name but this is basically a collection of R Markdown templates.
There are currently five templates available in the *amaryaml* package:

1. Book
1. Eisvogel

   This is basically a simple document template.
   It is much better than the default pandoc template.

1. GitHub

   The main advantage of using this template over the default R Markdown `github_document` output is that this template shifts heading levels by 1.
   This basically means that you can use `#` headings instead of `##` headings.
   It is a minor issue that I think is worth using my template to fix.

1. NorBeam

   This is a slideshow template that uses the Nord color scheme.
   It looks much better than any other beamer theme.

1. Leaflet

   There is no good documentation on how to make leaflets in R Markdown.
   With this template, it is already set up for you.
   It could not be easier than this.
