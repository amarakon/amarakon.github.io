      <description>https://github.com/amarakon/amarlay
Unlike AmaRYAML, Amarlay has a great name. It is a Gentoo overlay that includes dozens of unique packages, most of them not found in any other repository. Obviously, this will only be useful to Gentoo users. The best packages it includes are Zsh plugins, nerd-fonts-inconsolata, cfetch, and many Neovim plugins.</description>

      <description>https://github.com/amarakon/amaryaml
It has a terrible name but this is basically a collection of R Markdown templates. There are currently five templates available in the amaryaml package:
  Book
  Eisvogel
This is basically a simple document template. It is much better than the default pandoc template.

      <description>https://github.com/amarakon/cfetch
Cfetch is a suckless-like command-line system information tool. It displays information about your operating system, kernel, packages, and more along with ASCII art of your operating system in an elegant way. The purpose of Cfetch is to quickly get information about everything quickly instead of using one different program for getting each piece of information.</description>

      <title>DFM – dmenu File Manager</title>

      <description>https://github.com/amarakon/dfm
The dmenu file manager is the best and fastest way to manage files! It is even faster than using the terminal, but has the perks of a graphical user interface. Therefore, it has the best of both worlds. You can use it to quickly open files in literally around one second.</description>

      <title>FFrec – FFmpeg Record</title>

      <description>https://github.com/amarakon/ffrec
It is annoying when the command-line option is too minimalist while the graphical option is too bloated. FFrec uses FFmpeg to record but makes it less of a hassle. It makes it just as easy to record with FFmpeg as it is with OBS. Actually, it is even easier. No setup is required because the defaults are already fantastic.</description>

      <description>https://github.com/amarakon/magickshot
MagickShot is a program I created because I am surprised it does not exist yet. It is a screenshot utility, but there are many screenshot utilities. However, none of them do everything I want them to do:
 screenshot with mouse selection sceenshot a specified window screenshot a specified monitor screenshot the entire display  Most of them only support the first and last options.</description>

      <description>This is a list of the most important software and hardware I use. It may include programs that I have developed myself (see my projects page).
  What Makes a Good Program  I do not endorse the use of proprietary software because it is immoral and bad. I use software that is minimal, extensible, and fast.</description>

      <description>Introduction  https://github.com/amarakon/vim-sensible-autocomp
This is yet another auto-completion plugin for Vim. At this point, there are probably hundreds. So I will explain what makes mine stand out from the rest. The main reason I wrote this plugin is that I wanted an auto-completion plugin written purely in Vim script or Lua.</description>

      <description>Introduction  Vim is a text editor that is great on its own but is heavily improved by various plugins. The vast majority of the plugins in this article will not be language-specific, so they will apply whether you are coding in C or just writing a random text file.</description>

      <description>Recall from my second article on this website that I did not like my school&amp;rsquo;s computer science club. I listed several reasons for it, and I will briefly summarize them here.
 The teacher taught in a traditional way rather than what I expected. Only the Python programming language is taught.</description>

      <description>I always support minimizing the amount of money you spend on technology. I have made that crystal clear. There are many things that people are spending way too much money on. But there are also many things that people are buying that they do not even need. An example of this is the mouse.</description>

      <title>ThinkPad Laptops are Timeless Machines</title>

      <guid>https://amarakon.github.io/articles/thinkpad-laptops-are-timeless-machines/</guid>
      <description>It is important to favor timeless computers over timed ones. Timed computers are designed to last only a short period of time; maybe a year or so. This is because they are designed to be not only fragile but also difficult to repair. This cruel combination manifests a consumerist mindset into most people.</description>

      <description>Qualifications  In order for me to consider them good, web browsers must
  not send analytics. It should not make analytics either. I do not want to hear about how it maintains the software’s survival. I genuinely do not care. I do not want “bug reports.”</description>

      <title>Comparing the Best Markup Languages for Making PDF Documents</title>

      <description>PDF is rightfully the standard output format for documents. All word processors can output to PDF, but it is difficult to convert PDF to files word processors can edit. Most people use “what you see is what you get” word processors like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LibreOffice Writer. This type of word processor is convenient but it is also limited and unprofessional.</description>

      <title>You Should Prefer Command-Line Software</title>
      <link>https://amarakon.github.io/articles/you-should-prefer-command-line-software/</link>

      <guid>https://amarakon.github.io/articles/you-should-prefer-command-line-software/</guid>
      <description>There are many benefits of preferring command-line software over graphical software. Graphical User Interfaces generally promote lazy thinking. Command-line interfaces generally promote critical thinking. I think it is unfortunate that most people have not even heard of command-line software. Whenever I would be doing my work in school by running commands, most people who pass by would assume that I am coding.</description>

      <guid>https://amarakon.github.io/articles/programming-is-invaluable-for-everyone/</guid>
      <description>Most people view programming as something that only a specific type of people are able to do and should do. This specific type of person is portrayed as a genius; smarter than everyone else. This means that they think most normal people are unable to learn programming because they are not smart enough.</description>
