      <description>Recall from my second article on this website that I did not like my school&amp;rsquo;s computer science club. I listed several reasons for it, and I will briefly summarize them here.

      <description>Similar to my programs page, this webpage will list programs that I endorse. But this is only for programs that I have specifically created.

      <description>I am a high school student who happens to be genuinely interested in technology. Specifically, I am interested in operating systems, programming, and free software philosophy.
