      <description>Similar to my programs page, this webpage will list programs that I endorse. But this is only for programs that I have specifically created. My software projects are available on GitHub. And I have plenty of good ones. I believe they should be more popular, but I am not sure how to bring more attention to them.</description>

      <description>I am a high school student who happens to be genuinely interested in technology. Specifically, I am interested in operating systems, programming, and free software philosophy.
