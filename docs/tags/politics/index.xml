      <description>You cannot change the reality of who you are. You cannot change your race, sex, age because those are immutable properties. Most people in society understand and accept this fact. But the left has created terms called “gender” and “transgender” to get around this. They know believe it is possible to change one’s sex, but they relabeled it as “gender.” They argue that sex is biological while gender is a social construct.</description>

      <description>Conservatives and liberals strongly disagree on when killing another human being should be considered acceptable. They both agree that killing is justified in self-defense, but the agreements end there. Conservatives usually think that abortion and euthanasia are wrong while capital punishment (the death penalty) is just. They argue that killing an innocent and defenseless person (abortion and euthanasia) is always wrong while killing soulless criminals (the death penalty) is just. On the other hand, liberals think that abortion and euthanasia are sometimes justifiable while the death penalty is unjust.</description>
