      <description>Conservatives and liberals strongly disagree on when killing another human being should be considered acceptable. They both agree that killing is justified in self-defense, but the agreements end there. Conservatives usually think that abortion and euthanasia are wrong while capital punishment (the death penalty) is just. They argue that killing an innocent and defenseless person (abortion and euthanasia) is always wrong while killing soulless criminals (the death penalty) is just. On the other hand, liberals think that abortion and euthanasia are sometimes justifiable while the death penalty is unjust. They argue that it is a woman’s right to choose, we should end the suffering of ill people, and that the death penalty is too harsh and cruel.</description>
