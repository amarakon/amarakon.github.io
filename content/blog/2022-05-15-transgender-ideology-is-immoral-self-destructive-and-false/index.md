You cannot change the reality of who you are.
You cannot change your race, sex, age because those are immutable properties.
Most people in society understand and accept this fact.
But the left has created terms called “gender” and “transgender” to get around this.
They know believe it is possible to change one’s sex, but they relabeled it as “gender.”
They argue that sex is biological while gender is a social construct.
Well, if sex is the biological truth and gender is a made-up, incorrect social construct, why should not we be truthful and get rid of the made-up, incorrect social construct?
If gender is truly a social construct, why are we even giving value to such a “social construct?”
The term *gender* was invented to make something that is impossible seem possible.

Gender identity was invented by a sexologist named John Money ([Wikipedia, 2022](#ref-wikijohn-money)).
He forced the sex-reassignment of David Reimer by giving him estrogen.
David ended up killing himself when he was 38 years old.
John Money used David and his brother for sexual rehearsal play and photographed it.
His brother also committed suicide.
It does not look good when an ideology was born from a pedophile.

# False

Transgender ideology is false because everyone who is transgender is not a member of the sex they claim to be.
People who believe in this ideology admit that sex is biological, thus impossible to change.
That means that transgender people can only change their gender, but not their sex.
They also admit that gender is a meaningless social construct.
That means that transgender people are only *pretending* to be a member of the opposite sex.
*Pretending* implies that it is not actually true.
The phrase “trans women are women” is incorrect because transgender women only pretend to be women.

A *man* is an adult male human.
A *woman* is an adult female human.
A *male* is a sex of an organism which produces sperm.
A *female* is a sex of an organism which produces ova.
If you identify as a man but you cannot produce sperm, you are not a man.
If you identify as a woman but you cannot produce ova, you are not a woman.
Since gender is a meaningless social construct, we have to use biology to define men and women.
The biology of a transgender man is that of a real woman and the biology of a transgender woman is that of a real man.

Most transgender people want to change their pronouns.
They do not want their pronouns to align with their true sex, rather they want them to align with their false gender.
This is blatantly dishonest because there are no limits as to what your pronouns can be.
As a boy, I can very easily identify as a girl and everyone would have to play along with that lie
Being transgender is living a lie, and we should not play along with peoples’ delusions.

# Self-Destructive

Transgender ideology is self-destructive because it is mutilation and a form of self-harm.
*Mutilation* is cutting off or causing injury to a body part of a person so that the part of the body is permanently damaged, detached or disfigured.
*Self-harm* is intentional injury to one’s own body without the intention of suicide.
Sex reassignment surgery is (by definition) mutilation.
Chopping off your penis, breasts, or other body parts to detach them is obviously mutilation.
Similarly, transgender hormone therapy is self-harm because there are many dangerous side effects.
It is unsurprisingly difficult to find a professional list of the side effects of transgender hormone therapy.
This is obviously because this is a political issue, and the radical left controls the flow of information.
Detransgender activist Helena Kerschner shared her experiences with conservative Michael Knowles (14:20):

# Immoral

A white person named Oli London wants penis reduction surgery to be “100% Korean” ([Cheong, 2022](#ref-white-korean)).
I am not sure if Oli London is a man or a woman, because Oli identifies as non-binary.
This is one of the problems with gender ideology in general.
I do not know the reality of who Oli is because Oli is living a lie.
Oli is not just living one lie, but two lies
Oli not only thinks that “they” are non-binary, but “they” also believe that “they” are Korean.
Society thinks that Oli is immoral because it is not true that Oli is Korean.
But why cannot we make that same argument for transgender ideology?
It is not true that Oli is non-binary either.
Most of the people who reject Oli’s idea of being Korean still use Oli’s preferred pronouns.
They call pretending to be a member of a different race “cultural appropriation” but they contrarily call pretending to be a member of the opposite sex “transgender.”
This is hypocrisy at its finest.

Transgender ideology is immoral because it is false and self-destructive.
It is the rejection of the beautiful, pure body that you were born with.
Everyone is created in God’s image and it is disrespectful to reject that image.
Whenever we look at people with tattoos all over their body, we immediately have some thoughts.
We usually think “how could someone do that to themselves?”
I am sure that we think the same way of transgender people, but most people pretend not to.
Similar to painting your entire body with tattoos, being transgender makes you look ugly.
You were better off keeping your body as-is.

# Gender Dysphoria

The only other argument you could make in support of transgender ideology is that it is a solution to gender dysphoria.
To refer to the Michael Knowles interview with Helena Kerschner, Helena falsely believed that she has gender dysphoria.
She was told that many things were signs of gender dysphoria, and she had some of those symptoms.
This brainwashed her into believing that she is a man in a woman’s body.
She was then brainwashed into taking an unhealthy amount of testosterone injections.
She was told that testosterone injections will improve her life in every way and fix her gender dysphoria, but that is just not true.
As you can imagine, this did not turn out well for her.
She later figured out that none of the things promised to her came true.
This is called *rapid-onset gender dysphoria*.

Gender dysphoria is an undoubtedly tragic disorder.
I will never deny that.
But it is disgusting to suggest that sex hormones and sex-reassignment surgery are solutions.
The suicide rate among people with gender dysphoria is extraordinarily high, but there is no evidence that suggests sex hormones and sex-reassignment surgery decrease it.
According to [APA](#ref-mental-disorders) ([2013](#ref-mental-disorders)), “Those who had received a diagnosis of gender identity disorder or transsexualism and were seeking hormone treatment and/or surgery” is only .005 to .014% for males and .002 to .003% for females.
However, that number is rapidly and tremendously increasing.
This could only possibly be caused by indoctrination.
