# Introduction

Vim is a text editor that is great on its own but is heavily improved by various
plugins.
The vast majority of the plugins in this article will not be language-specific,
so they will apply whether you are coding in C or just writing a random text
file.
I do indeed use Neovim and not Vim, but there is only one plugin in this list
that is Neovim-specific.
And it does have Vim-compatible alternatives anyway.
Also, some of the plugins here are criminally underrated.

# Plugins

## Automation

1. [Auto Pairs](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs)

   This plugin automatically inserts a pair of brackets, parentheses, and quotes
   in a pair.
   This is especially convenient when programming because you will no longer have
   errors because you forgot to end a string.
   You might think that this could slow you down, but it does not.
   Luckily, there are at least three ways to insert things purely.

   1. `Ctrl-V` followed by the character to insert
   1. `Alt-P` to toggle the plugin
   1. `Del` to delete extra character

1. [surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)

   This is another plugin for brackets, parentheses, and quotes.
   This plugin is all about "surroundings".
   You can delete/change/add brackets, parentheses, quotes, etc.
   I used to always just manually move the cursor to the beginning and end of a
   pair to do this.
   This plugin is great when paired with auto-pairs.

1. [latex-unicoder](https://github.com/joom/latex-unicoder.vim)

   One thing I surely hate to do is go on the internet just to copy and paste a
   certain Unicode symbol.
   If only there was a way to automate this in Vim, that would be great.
   That's where latex-unicoder comes into play.
   For those of you who are familiar with LaTeX, it allows you to type the LaTeX
   names of the Unicode characters and latex-unicoder will replace them with the
   actual symbol.
   If you do not know LaTeX, do not worry.
   You can just look at the [LaTeX character map](http://milde.users.sourceforge.net/LUCR/Math/).

## Languages

4. [emmet](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim)

   This plugin is specific to HTML, and I rarely write HTML.
   However, it is too good to not have it in this list.
   Everyone agrees that HTML is one of the easiest markup languages to learn.
   So easy that it is not even fair to call it a programming language.
   But just like LaTeX, its syntax is quite annoying to work with.
   It is way too time consuming just to write a single HTML page.

   emmet creates shortcuts so that it is much faster to do so.
   Consider the following example of the minimum that is needed for an HTML
   document.
   The first code block will be what you need to write with emmet.
   The second code block will be the result after pressing `Ctrl-Y` `,`.

   ```html
   html:5
   ```

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
   	<meta charset="UTF-8">
   	<title></title>
   </head>
   <body>
   	â”‚
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   That was just one example out of dozens.
   You should now definitely see why this plugin is a must-have for HTML developers.

1. [Markdown](https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown)

   This is another plugin for a markup language.
   This time, it is Markdown.
   It has a lot of features suited for Markdown users.
   But to be honest, I only use it for the syntax highlighting for fenced code
   block languages.

1. [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale)

   Asynchronous Lint Engine is not language specific, but it generally helps you
   when programming in any language.
   It provides syntax checking and semantic errors.
   This means that as you write code, it will check for anything wrong and
   notify you if there is.
   You will save yourself from testing and debugging when using this plugin.
   The best part is that it is automatic.
   ALE is my favourite plugin for Vim by far.

## Syntax

7. [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)

   airline is a lean and mean status bar for Vim that is as light as air.
   It includes many important details on the status bar, like the Git branch,
   files, file type, and more.
   My favourite part about it is its integration with other plugins.
   There is an entire [list](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline#seamless-integration) of plugins that it interacts with.
   This includes ALE.

1. [Colorizer](https://github.com/lilydjwg/colorizer)

   Colorizer does exactly what you expect it to do: it colourizes things.
   It colourizes text in the form `#rgb`, `#rgba`, `#rrggbb`, `#rrggbbaa`, etc.
   I do not want to use a colour picker in order to see what a colour looks
   like.

1. [gentoo-syntax](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo-syntax)

   This plugin is only useful for people who use the Gentoo GNU/Linux operating
   system.
   It provides syntax highlighting for certain Gentoo configuration files.

1. [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-vim)

   This plugin is a Vim colour theme: Nord.
   I love the Nord colour theme because it is easy on the eyes and beautiful.

```{r, nord, fig.cap = "Nord Vim color theme"}
include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcticicestudio/nord-docs/develop/assets/images/ports/vim/overview-go.png")
```

11. [Indent Blankline](https://github.com/lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim)

    This plugin ports something to Vim that I like from Visual Studio Code.
    It draws vertical lines for indents, allowing you to see the beginning and
    end of an indentation.
    This is not very useful, but it looks very good, so I like it.

1. [Rainbow Parentheses Improved](https://github.com/luochen1990/rainbow)

   It sometimes stresses my eyes to look for the beginning and end of a pair of
   parentheses or brackets.
   This plugin simply gives each pair a unique colour.

## Convenience

13. [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)

    fzf is a nice fuzzy finder that allows you to quickly search for something.
    This pairs nicely with Vim so that you can easily search for commands, file
    types.
    It is recommended to write your own Vim commands with it to further improve
    your workflow.

1. [Supertab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab)

   Supertab allows you to use the `Tab` key for insert completions.
   For example, if you have a variable named `variable`, you can type `var` and
   press tab to complete it.
   This prevents you from having to type things out completely.

1. [commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)

   This plugin allows you to comment lines or paragraphs in basically any
   programming language with a simple Vim keybinding.
   You can also add your own comment strings if your file type is not supported.
   I like to bind `Ctrl-C` to this command.

1. [repeat](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat)

   The only reason you should use this plugin is if you used other plugins in
   this list, especially plugins made by [tpope](https://github.com/tpope).
   This basically makes the repeat binding in Vim (`.`) work with those plugins
   as well.

1. [visual-multi](https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi)

   The visual-multi plugin allows you to have multiple cursors.
   This is even more powerful than the visual block mode.
   For example, you can quickly add a string to the end of a few lines, even if
   they have different lengths.
   Also, it provides better visual feedback.
   You can actually see multiple cursors typing the same thing and it is
   satisfying.

## Git

18. [fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)

    fugitive is such a good plugin that it should be illegal.
    It allows Git to integrate with Vim.
    This is basically my best dream as a plugin.
    I hate having to open another terminal window just to use simple Git commands.
    And using this plugin is even faster than using native Git.
    The only problem I have with it is that the `git push` command does not seem
    to work.
    I will try to find a fix for it soon though.

1. [rhubarb](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rhubarb)

   This plugin is similar to fugitive, and they are both made by tpope.
   However, rhubarb is for just GitHub instead of Git in general.
   It allows commands like `:GBrowse` to browse files with the GitHub file
   viewer.

1. [gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter)

   gitgutter sort of reminds me of ALE.
   It is basically the same concept except instead of doing syntax checking, it
   does diff checking.
   It checks for differences in the file compared to the last Git commit.
   This helps you track your own changes better.
   It has different syntax for removed lines, changed lines, and added lines.
   Just like ALE, it is eye-pleasing.
   Although it is a little bit less useful.
