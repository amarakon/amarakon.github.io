Unlike [AmaRYAML](../amaryaml/), Amarlay has a great name.
It is a Gentoo overlay that includes dozens of unique packages, most of them not found in any other repository.
Obviously, this will only be useful to Gentoo users.
The best packages it includes are Zsh plugins, *nerd-fonts-inconsolata*, *cfetch*, and many Neovim plugins.
It also includes ebuilds for all of my GitHub repositories.
So if you are a Gentoo user, and you like my software, enable this overlay!
