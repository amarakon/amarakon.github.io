Welcome! This is my personal website. I am a programmer who loves Gentoo because it is the best operating system ever made. Also, I am only excellent at shell because I have not taken the time to master other languages. However, I still know C, R, HTML, CSS, TeX. See my [about](/about/) page for more details.
